# healthcare-risk-model
This project aims to analyze and predict healthcare trends and risk factors using statistical modelling. The focus is on applying data cleaning, EDA, logistic regression modeling, and data visualizations. 

# Objectives

- Source and preprocess healthcare data from publicly available databases (e.g., WHO).
- Conduct EDA to identify patterns, distributions, and data quality issues.
- Build and evaluate a logistic regression model to predict a target health outcome.
- Visualize results with clear, interpretable charts using Python libraries.
